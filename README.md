# UAlberta eClass downloader

## ARCHIVED
I'm no longer a student at the U of A, feel free to fork and update as necessary.

This is a script to download pdf files from eclass, you guys might find it useful especially during COVID.

Try to use it sparingly, don't hammer the damn page. I don't want to get expelled for this.

## DON'T USE THIS FOR COPYRIGHT INFRINGEMENT

Don't upload course files to chegg/coursehero/oneclass please. Those sites are garbage anyway.
